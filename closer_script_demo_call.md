## ⏱️ THE 15-MINUTE ARCHITECTURE

### **Minute 0-2: THE HOOK (Compliance Pain)**

```
"Thanks for taking the call. I'll keep this to 15 minutes because I know 
your time is valuable—and frankly, so is the revenue you're leaving on 
the table.

We ran an intelligence sweep on Quebec-based digital brands, and 
Stingray flagged at 7 out of 10 for Bill 96 compliance risk. That's 
not just a legal issue—it's a market access issue. 

8.5 million French-speaking consumers in Quebec prefer brands that 
speak their language. When they see an English-only ad, they scroll."
```

**Transition:** "But compliance is just the table stakes..."

---

### **Minute 2-8: THE DEMONSTRATION (AdGenXai Power)**

```
"Here's what traditional agencies do in 3 weeks:
- Research the market
- Brainstorm creative
- Write copy
- Get approvals
- Launch

Our autonomous swarm does this in 10 MINUTES.

[Share Screen - Show Demo]

Watch this. I'm going to have our Manus AI generate 10 ad variants 
for Stingray's new campaign—localized for Quebecois culture, not 
just translated.

[Run: Manus generates ads live or show pre-generated examples]

See that? That's 'Joual'—the local dialect. Not textbook French. 
Real Quebecois culture. Meta's algorithm will eat this up because 
it resonates. CTR jumps 40% when the creative matches the culture."
```

**Key Metrics to Mention:**
- 100x faster creative production
- 90% cost reduction vs traditional agency ($15K/mo → $3.5K/mo)
- 3-5x ROI improvement through autonomous optimization

---

### **Minute 8-12: THE OFFER (Imperial Growth Package)**

```
"Here's the package:

✓ Weekly AI-generated creative (10 variants/week)
✓ Bill 96 compliance verification on every asset
✓ Meta Ads autonomous optimization (AI manages the spend)
✓ Real-time performance dashboard
✓ Monthly strategic intelligence report

Investment: $3,500 per month.

Compare that to a traditional agency at $15,000+ per month with 
3-week turnaround times. We're faster, cheaper, and the AI never 
sleeps—it optimizes 24/7.

The compliance audit alone is worth $750. That's included in month 
one. We identify every gap, fix it, and launch the first campaign 
within 72 hours of signing."
```

**Pause. Wait for response.**

---

### **Minute 12-14: OBJECTION HANDLING**

**If they say: "We already have an agency"**
```
"Perfect. Keep them for the big brand campaigns. We're not replacing 
your agency—we're augmenting them for the Quebec market specifically. 

Think of us as your 'Souverain Strike Team'—we handle the high-frequency, 
localized Meta ads that require cultural fluency your agency doesn't have. 
You don't fire your general counsel when you hire a tax specialist."
```

**If they say: "$3,500 is a lot"**
```
"It's $116 per day. One missed compliance fine from OQLF is $30,000. 
One successful campaign that hits the Quebec market properly pays for 
this for 8 months.

But I get it—let's de-risk this. 

Option A: $3,500/mo, month-to-month. Cancel anytime.
Option B: Start with just the $750 Imperial Audit. We identify the 
compliance gaps, you see our work quality, then we talk retainer.

Which feels safer to you?"
```

**If they say: "We need to think about it"**
```
"Of course. Here's what I'll do—I'll send you the audit report and 
3 sample AI-generated ads specific to Stingray. You show them to 
your team. If they don't immediately see the Quebec market opportunity, 
we're not the right fit.

But if they do, we schedule a follow-up this Friday. Fair?"
```

---

### **Minute 14-15: THE CLOSE**

```
"So where are we? Are we:

1. Moving forward with the $3,500/mo retainer?
2. Starting with the $750 audit to prove value?
3. Or do you need to see those 3 sample ads first?

[Wait for answer]

Great. I'll send the agreement within the hour. First campaign goes 
live within 72 hours of signature. Welcome to the Sovereign model, 
[Name]."
```

## ⚜️ THE CLOSER'S MINDSET

**Remember:**
- You're not selling "AI"—you're selling **revenue** and **compliance**
- You're not expensive—you're **90% cheaper** than alternatives

Stingray doesn't have it. You can fix that in 72 hours.**

Close the deal. Fuel the Flywheel. ⚜️
